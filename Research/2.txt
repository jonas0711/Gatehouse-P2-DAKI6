# Simple Machine Learning Models for Maritime AIS Data Analysis: Applications Beyond Deep Learning

The global maritime industry is increasingly leveraging machine learning (ML) technology in conjunction with Automatic Identification System (AIS) data to enhance operational efficiency, safety, and predictive capabilities. While deep learning and neural networks have gained prominence in many AI applications, simpler machine learning models offer significant advantages in maritime contexts, including interpretability, computational efficiency, and effectiveness with limited training data. This report examines cases where traditional machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to AIS data from ships, highlighting their methodologies, effectiveness, and practical applications.

## The Fundamentals of AIS Data in Maritime Machine Learning

Automatic Identification System (AIS) data serves as the cornerstone for machine learning applications in the maritime domain. This standardized tracking system, mandatory for vessels exceeding certain size thresholds, continuously transmits vital information including vessel position, speed, course, and identification details. Historical AIS data provides an extensive foundation for training machine learning models, enabling them to discern patterns in vessel behavior, movement, and characteristics over time[1].

The principle of "quality in, quality out" remains paramount when working with AIS data for machine learning applications. The predictive accuracy of models directly correlates with both the quality and quantity of the training data provided. Spire Maritime's extensive historical AIS dataset, dating back to 2010, exemplifies the type of robust foundation necessary for developing effective predictive analytics in the maritime sector[1]. When properly processed and analyzed, this wealth of information enables machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions without requiring the computational complexity of deep learning architectures.

Machine learning models trained on historical AIS data can process information about vessel movements, characteristics, and behaviors to identify patterns that would be impossible for human analysts to detect manually. This capability transforms raw AIS data streams into actionable intelligence for various maritime stakeholders, from shipping companies to port authorities and environmental regulators. The marriage of AIS data with accessible machine learning techniques represents a significant advancement in maritime technology, offering solutions that balance sophistication with practical implementation considerations.

## Tree-Based Classification Models for Ship Type Identification

Among the most effective non-neural network approaches to AIS data analysis are tree-based classification models. A comprehensive study published in Electronics (2024) demonstrated that tree-structure-based classifiers, particularly XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms, outperformed other methods in ship classification tasks based on AIS data[2]. These ensemble learning methods, which combine multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting, proved especially suitable for the multidimensional nature of maritime data.

The study collected AIS data from the Changhua Wind Farm Channel and performed extensive feature extraction, yielding 14-dimensional features encompassing various ship-geometric and trajectory behaviors. These features included physical characteristics such as ship width and perimeter, alongside behavioral elements like speed, heading, and lateral deviation distance[2]. When various classification algorithms were evaluated, the tree-based models consistently demonstrated superior performance metrics compared to alternative approaches.

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) and Random Forest algorithms exhibited particular strength in handling the complex relationships between ship characteristics and their behavioral patterns. These methods effectively captured the nuances in how different vessel types navigate waterways, maintain speed, and position themselves within shipping channels. The sequential improvement mechanism in XGBoost, where each new tree corrects errors made by the ensemble of previous trees, proved especially effective at distinguishing between vessel types with subtle behavioral differences[2].

## Feature Engineering and Selection for Optimal Model Performance

One of the most significant insights from recent research involves the critical importance of feature selection in developing efficient ship classification models. The Electronics study implemented a feature selection strategy using five different methods, demonstrating that high classification accuracy could be achieved with just four carefully selected features—three ship-geometric features (width, perimeter, and bridge position ratio) and one trajectory behavior feature (speed)[2]. This finding has profound implications for the practical implementation of machine learning systems in maritime contexts, where computational efficiency and real-time processing capabilities are often essential.

The study introduced a particularly valuable feature called "Bridge Position Ratio (BP)," which measures the relative location of a ship's bridge along its length. This feature proved highly significant in differentiating between vessel types, as bridge placement varies systematically across different ship categories[2]. Container ships, for instance, typically have bridges positioned near the stern, while other vessel types show different characteristic placements. This exemplifies how domain-specific knowledge can inform feature engineering to dramatically improve model performance without requiring the complexity of deep learning approaches.

Various feature selection techniques were employed to identify the most informative subset of features, including Variable Ranking, Correlation Matrix analysis, and algorithm-specific importance measures from Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers[2]. Remarkably, these different methods converged on similar sets of top features, reinforcing their importance across different analytical frameworks. The finding that a highly reduced feature set could maintain classification accuracy demonstrates the potential for creating streamlined, efficient models that avoid the dimensionality challenges often associated with complex maritime data.

## Non-Deep Learning Classification Algorithms for Maritime Applications

Beyond tree-based methods, several other traditional machine learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in maritime applications. The Electronics study evaluated Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) alongside the tree-based methods[2]. While these algorithms didn't match the performance of XGBoost and Random Forest in the specific task of ship classification, they remain valuable tools in the maritime analytics toolkit, each with distinct advantages in certain scenarios.

Linear Discriminant Analysis operates by finding linear combinations of features that best separate different classes, making it particularly useful when class distributions have significantly different means but similar variances. The study noted that LDA's computational complexity scales quadratically with the number of samples and dimensions, which can become costly with high-dimensional data[2]. Nevertheless, for datasets with well-separated vessel classes and moderate dimensionality, LDA offers an interpretable and computationally accessible approach.

Support Vector Machines work by identifying a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes in feature space. For linear SVM implementations, the computational complexity is proportional to the number of features and samples, making them reasonably efficient for moderately sized maritime datasets[2]. SVM's ability to handle non-linear relationships through kernel functions provides flexibility without entering deep learning territory, offering a balance between model sophistication and interpretability that is often desirable in maritime applications.

Each of these algorithms can be applied to multi-class problems common in maritime analytics, such as distinguishing between cargo ships, tankers, passenger vessels, and fishing boats. The appropriate choice depends on dataset characteristics, computational constraints, and the specific requirements of the maritime application being developed.

## Practical Applications of AIS-Based Machine Learning in Maritime Industries

The application of machine learning to AIS data extends far beyond academic exercises, addressing critical real-world challenges throughout the maritime industry. Spire Maritime and Freightflows have demonstrated how historical AIS data can fuel predictive analytics across numerous practical domains[1]. These applications showcase how relatively straightforward machine learning approaches can deliver substantial operational value.

Predictive maintenance represents one of the most impactful applications, where models analyze historical vessel movement patterns to anticipate maintenance needs before equipment failure occurs. By identifying subtle changes in vessel behavior that may indicate developing mechanical issues, these predictive models help shipping companies reduce costly downtime and optimize maintenance scheduling[1]. The interpretability of simpler machine learning models proves particularly valuable in this context, as maintenance engineers often require clear explanations of why a system is flagging potential issues.

Optimal route planning represents another domain where machine learning excels without requiring deep neural architectures. By analyzing historical AIS trajectories alongside weather and ocean condition data, relatively straightforward regression and classification models can identify efficiency patterns that lead to reduced voyage times and fuel consumption[1]. These models can incorporate variables such as seasonal patterns, typical congestion in shipping lanes, and historical performance of similar vessels to recommend optimized routes.

Emissions tracking has gained increasing importance as the maritime industry faces growing regulatory pressure to reduce its environmental impact. Machine learning models trained on AIS data can identify high-emission vessels and operational patterns that contribute disproportionately to pollution[1]. Decision tree-based models prove particularly effective here, as they can incorporate branching logic that accounts for the complex interplay between vessel characteristics, operational patterns, and resulting emissions profiles.

Other practical applications include commodity trading support, where models analyze vessel movements to anticipate market changes; supply chain optimization, where bottlenecks and inefficiencies can be identified through pattern recognition; and marine insurance risk assessment, where historical vessel behavior contributes to more accurate premium calculations[1]. Each of these use cases demonstrates how accessible machine learning techniques can transform maritime operations without requiring the computational intensity or data volumes associated with deep learning approaches.

## Feature Importance and Model Optimization in Maritime Analytics

The process of determining which AIS-derived features contribute most significantly to model performance represents a crucial aspect of maritime machine learning development. Research has demonstrated that different selection methods often highlight similar key features, suggesting fundamental relationships between certain vessel characteristics and their classification[2]. Understanding these relationships enables more efficient model design and potentially reveals insights about maritime operations that might otherwise remain hidden.

The Electronics study implemented multiple feature selection approaches, including algorithm-independent methods like Variable Ranking and Correlation Matrix analysis, alongside algorithm-specific importance measures derived from the Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers themselves[2]. Remarkably, these diverse methods showed substantial agreement about which features carried the most predictive power. Both algorithm-independent methods identified the same top seven features, with six relating to ship-geometric characteristics and only one (median speed) representing trajectory behavior[2].

This convergence suggests that physical vessel characteristics often provide stronger classification signals than behavioral features, at least for the specific classification task examined. The bridge position ratio (BP) consistently ranked as one of the most important features across all selection methods, highlighting how structural design elements that might seem minor can actually provide critical differentiation between vessel types[2]. This finding illustrates how domain knowledge combined with data-driven feature selection can identify non-obvious predictors that greatly enhance model performance.

The optimization process also revealed that progressively adding features yielded diminishing returns after a certain point. Models trained using just the top four important features—width, perimeter, bridge position ratio, and median speed—achieved remarkably high classification accuracy[2]. This demonstrates the potential for creating streamlined, efficient models that minimize computational requirements while maintaining robust performance, an important consideration for real-time maritime applications where processing resources may be limited.

## Conclusion

The application of simpler machine learning techniques to AIS data represents a powerful approach for addressing numerous challenges in the maritime industry. While deep learning and neural networks continue to advance the boundaries of what's possible in artificial intelligence, this report has demonstrated that more traditional machine learning methods offer considerable advantages in many maritime contexts—including interpretability, efficiency with limited data, reduced computational requirements, and excellent performance on specific maritime tasks.

Tree-based methods, particularly Random Forest and XGBoost, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in ship classification tasks, effectively leveraging both physical and behavioral features extracted from AIS data[2]. Other approaches, including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, provide additional tools that may be preferable in certain maritime applications with specific data characteristics or analytical requirements[2].

The feature selection and engineering processes revealed by recent research highlight how domain knowledge can be leveraged to dramatically improve model performance without increasing model complexity. The discovery that just four carefully selected features could achieve high classification accuracy demonstrates the potential for creating streamlined, efficient models for maritime applications[2].

As maritime industries continue their digital transformation, these accessible machine learning approaches offer practical pathways for leveraging the wealth of information contained in AIS data streams. From optimizing vessel operations to enhancing safety and supporting environmental compliance, traditional machine learning techniques will continue to play a crucial role alongside more complex approaches, providing immediate value while requiring fewer resources to implement and maintain.
