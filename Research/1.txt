Got it! I will research various AI/ML models that utilize AIS data from ships, excluding those that rely on deep learning or neural networks. The focus will be on simpler models and their applications, such as traffic prediction, collision avoidance, anomaly detection, and more.

I will get back to you once I have gathered relevant cases.

# Classical AI/ML Models for AIS Ship Data (Non-Deep Learning Approaches)

Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from ships has been leveraged in many maritime AI/ML applications without resorting to deep learning or neural networks. Below we explore how simpler models – decision trees, regression, clustering, rule-based systems, Bayesian models, etc. – are applied in key maritime domains, citing case studies, papers, and projects.

## Maritime Traffic Prediction
Predicting vessel movements, trajectories, or traffic patterns can be done with statistical and classical ML techniques using AIS data:

- **Markov Models:** Markov chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are widely used for vessel trajectory prediction ([Deep Learning for Vessel Trajectory Prediction Using Clustered AIS Data](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/16/2936#:~:text=Numerous%20studies%20have%20been%20conducted,such)). They model a ship’s next position based on its current state/probabilities, capturing typical movement patterns.
- **Time-Series Models:** State-space models like the Kalman Filter are applied for short-term position prediction and tracking using AIS feeds ([Deep Learning for Vessel Trajectory Prediction Using Clustered AIS Data](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/16/2936#:~:text=prediction%20tasks,26%20%2C%20142%2C28)). For example, an Extended Kalman Filter can smooth and predict a ship’s path in real time ([Vessel Trajectory Prediction Based on AIS Data: Dual-Path Spatial–Temporal Attention Network with Multi-Attribute Information](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/12/11/2031#:~:text=effective%20in%20curved%20inland%20waterways,based%20approaches%20often)).
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):** GMMs have been used to forecast ship positions with uncertainty estimation. One study applied GMMs for short-term trajectory prediction and combined them with PCA to generate multiple possible route outcomes ([Vessel Trajectory Prediction Based on AIS Data: Dual-Path Spatial–Temporal Attention Network with Multi-Attribute Information](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/12/11/2031#:~:text=Machine%20learning,difficult%20to%20adapt%20to%20rapidly)).
- **Support Vector Machines:** SVM/SVR (Support Vector Regression) models can learn vessel movement from historical AIS. Incorporating features like speed and course improved trajectory prediction, though SVMs may struggle to generalize broadly ([Vessel Trajectory Prediction Based on AIS Data: Dual-Path Spatial–Temporal Attention Network with Multi-Attribute Information](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/12/11/2031#:~:text=they%20often%20rely%20on%20many,23%5D%20utilize%20an%20ensemble)).
- **Ensemble Tree Models:** Decision trees and Random Forests have shown high accuracy in predicting vessel locations and destinations. For instance, a Random Forest model achieved R² ~0.99 in forecasting ship latitude/longitude and speed/heading over short durations ([AIS Data Driven Ship Behavior Modeling in Fairways: A Random Forest Based Approach](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/18/8484#:~:text=traffic%20management,It)). Similarly, Random Forests have been used to predict a ship’s likely destination by comparing its trajectory to historical routes ([Vessel Trajectory Prediction Based on AIS Data: Dual-Path Spatial–Temporal Attention Network with Multi-Attribute Information](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/12/11/2031#:~:text=they%20often%20rely%20on%20many,23%5D%20utilize%20an%20ensemble)).
- **Regression and Others:** Simpler regressions (linear, polynomial) and graphical models have also been explored. One extended linear regression model was proposed for vessel track forecasting ([Extended linear regression model for vessel trajectory prediction ...](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10095020.2022.2072241#:~:text=Extended%20linear%20regression%20model%20for,use%20of%20historic%20AIS%20data)), and ant colony optimization (a bio-inspired algorithm) combined with clustering has been used to estimate optimal vessel routes ([Deep Learning for Vessel Trajectory Prediction Using Clustered AIS Data](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/16/2936#:~:text=prediction%20tasks,26%20%2C%20142%2C28)).

## Collision Avoidance & Risk Assessment
Maritime safety systems often use rule-based logic and probabilistic models with AIS data to predict and prevent collisions:

- **Rule-Based Systems:** Collision avoidance for vessels can be handled by encoding navigational rules (COLREGs) and simple risk metrics. Systems commonly compute Distance to Closest Point of Approach (DCPA) and Time to CPA (TCPA) from AIS to warn of nearby ships ([](https://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/14875/3/Geometrical%20Risk%20Evaluation%20of%20the%20Collisions%20between%20Ships%20and%20Offshore%20Installations%20using%20Rule-based%20Bayesian%20Reasoning.pdf#:~:text=collision%20alert%20system%2C%20several%20geometric,and%20time%20to%20closest)). These metrics feed into rule-based decision engines that mimic human navigation rules. For example, a COLREGs-based collision avoidance algorithm uses a rule-based approach with a Collision Risk Index and ship domains to suggest safe maneuvers ([A conceptual COLREGs-based obstacle avoidance ... - JEMS](https://jemsjournal.org/jvi.aspx?un=JEMS-35682&volume=#:~:text=A%20conceptual%20COLREGs,and%20ship%20domain%20for)).
- **Fuzzy Logic:** Fuzzy rule-based models allow handling of uncertainties in collision risk. Some studies integrate multiple factors (e.g. distances, speeds, ship types) using fuzzy logic to output a “risk level.” Such approaches can aggregate inputs (possibly including AIS-derived parameters) into an overall collision risk score ([](https://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/14875/3/Geometrical%20Risk%20Evaluation%20of%20the%20Collisions%20between%20Ships%20and%20Offshore%20Installations%20using%20Rule-based%20Bayesian%20Reasoning.pdf#:~:text=developments%20in%20the%20collision%20alert,2020b%29%2C%20ship)).
- **Bayesian Networks:** Causation-based Bayesian networks are used to quantitatively assess collision risk by combining AIS data with environmental and vessel factors ([[PDF] Geometrical risk evaluation of the collisions between ships and ...](https://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/14875/3/Geometrical%20Risk%20Evaluation%20of%20the%20Collisions%20between%20Ships%20and%20Offshore%20Installations%20using%20Rule-based%20Bayesian%20Reasoning.pdf#:~:text=,AIS%20data%2C%20weather%20reports)). For example, a Bayesian network model can take a ship’s speed, course (from AIS) and weather conditions as inputs to compute the probability of collision in a given scenario ([[PDF] Geometrical risk evaluation of the collisions between ships and ...](https://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/14875/3/Geometrical%20Risk%20Evaluation%20of%20the%20Collisions%20between%20Ships%20and%20Offshore%20Installations%20using%20Rule-based%20Bayesian%20Reasoning.pdf#:~:text=,AIS%20data%2C%20weather%20reports)). These models encode expert knowledge as conditional probabilities (rules) and update risk in real time as situations evolve.
- **Friction and Domain Models:** In addition to ML, various analytic methods (ship domain models, linear danger zones, etc.) are used alongside AIS. They are not “learned” models but deterministic algorithms (often combined with the above). For instance, geometric methods using DCPA/TCPA, sometimes augmented by fuzzy logic or Bayesian reasoning, have been proposed to evaluate collision risk in vessel traffic systems ([](https://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/14875/3/Geometrical%20Risk%20Evaluation%20of%20the%20Collisions%20between%20Ships%20and%20Offshore%20Installations%20using%20Rule-based%20Bayesian%20Reasoning.pdf#:~:text=developments%20in%20the%20collision%20alert,2020b%29%2C%20ship)).

*(Case study:* A recent risk model for ship-offshore installation collisions combined rule-based logic with a Bayesian network to continuously evaluate collision risk using live AIS inputs ([[PDF] Geometrical risk evaluation of the collisions between ships and ...](https://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/14875/3/Geometrical%20Risk%20Evaluation%20of%20the%20Collisions%20between%20Ships%20and%20Offshore%20Installations%20using%20Rule-based%20Bayesian%20Reasoning.pdf#:~:text=,AIS%20data%2C%20weather%20reports)).*)*

## Route Optimization and Path Planning
AIS data can reveal typical routes and inform optimal path planning without deep learning:

- **Clustering for Route Extraction:** Unsupervised clustering methods help identify common maritime routes from historical AIS tracks. For example, Dynamic Time Warping coupled with HDBSCAN clustering has been used to automatically discover main shipping lanes in high-traffic areas ([Vessel Trajectory Prediction Based on AIS Data: Dual-Path Spatial–Temporal Attention Network with Multi-Attribute Information](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/12/11/2031#:~:text=classifier%20to%20categorize%20vessel%20trajectories%2C,planning%20and%20navigation%20in%20densely)). Grouping similar trajectories creates a “route map” that ships often follow.
- **Genetic Algorithms:** Evolutionary algorithms can optimize shipping routes for efficiency or safety. One study by Filipiak et al. used a genetic algorithm to automatically construct a maritime traffic network from AIS data, effectively mapping optimal paths through crowded waterways ([Vessel Trajectory Prediction Based on AIS Data: Dual-Path Spatial–Temporal Attention Network with Multi-Attribute Information](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/12/11/2031#:~:text=classifier%20to%20categorize%20vessel%20trajectories%2C,planning%20and%20navigation%20in%20densely)). The resulting network supports efficient path planning and navigation, avoiding congested or risky areas.
- **Ant Colony Optimization:** Bio-inspired algorithms like ant colony optimization have been applied to vessel routing problems. Researchers have combined clustering with an ant colony algorithm to find shortest or safest paths between ports based on AIS traffic patterns ([Deep Learning for Vessel Trajectory Prediction Using Clustered AIS Data](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/16/2936#:~:text=prediction%20tasks,26%20%2C%20142%2C28)). The algorithm iteratively improves routes by mimicking how ants find optimal paths, using AIS-derived waypoints and distances.
- **Heuristic and Rule-Based Routing:** Some route optimization is done with simple heuristics (e.g., avoid certain zones, prefer established lanes). AIS data feeds these heuristics by highlighting frequently used routes or areas to avoid (reefs, piracy zones, etc.). These approaches may not involve “learning” but are rule-based uses of AIS information to suggest efficient routes.

## Anomaly Detection in Vessel Behavior
Detecting unusual or illicit vessel behavior is a key AIS application using clustering and rule-based models:

- **Clustering & Outlier Detection:** A common approach is to learn “normal” movement patterns from AIS data and flag deviations. Density-based clustering like **DBSCAN** can cluster vessel trajectories or waypoints and label points that don’t fit any cluster as anomalies ([Modeling Vessel Behaviours by Clustering AIS Data Using Optimized DBSCAN](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/15/8162#:~:text=discover%20clusters%20of%20arbitrary%20shapes,13%2C14%2C15%2C16%2C%2011)). For instance, clusters might represent standard routes, while a ship deviating far from any known route would be an outlier (possible anomaly).
- **Statistical Density Models:** Instead of hard clusters, methods like Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) build a probability density map of typical vessel positions. The TREAD project (an open-source AIS anomaly detector) learns a statistical model of traffic density from historical AIS in an unsupervised way ([GitHub - LeoPits/Vessels-anomaly-detection-with-AIS-data: Anomaly detection from ships' Automatic Identification System (AIS) data](https://github.com/LeoPits/Vessels-anomaly-detection-with-AIS-data#:~:text=We%20takes%20inspiration%20from%20TREAD,data%20in%20an%20unsupervised%20way)). Given this model, it can identify routes or behaviors with abnormally low probability (e.g. a ship entering an unusual area or moving in an unexpected pattern) as potential anomalies ([GitHub - LeoPits/Vessels-anomaly-detection-with-AIS-data: Anomaly detection from ships' Automatic Identification System (AIS) data](https://github.com/LeoPits/Vessels-anomaly-detection-with-AIS-data#:~:text=It%20is%20necessary%20to%20remove,KDE)).
- **Rule-Based Anomaly Flags:** Domain experts often encode specific rules for anomalies – for example, “if a cargo ship slows to under 1 knot in open ocean, flag as suspicious.” These rules (derived from AIS features like speed, course, location) can catch behaviors like loitering at sea, sudden course changes, or entering restricted zones. While simple, they are effective for known indicators (e.g. illegal transshipment often involves certain speed patterns which can be caught by rule thresholds on AIS speed/course data).
- **Hybrid Systems:** Some systems combine clustering with rule filters. A vessel might first be classified into a route cluster, and then deviations from normal timing or speed on that route trigger an alert. This multi-step approach improves detection accuracy and reduces false alarms by accounting for known route variations.

*Examples:* An open-source project for AIS anomaly detection uses DBSCAN to identify key waypoints (ports, chokepoints) and typical routes between them, then applies statistical methods to detect deviations ([GitHub - LeoPits/Vessels-anomaly-detection-with-AIS-data: Anomaly detection from ships' Automatic Identification System (AIS) data](https://github.com/LeoPits/Vessels-anomaly-detection-with-AIS-data#:~:text=WPs%20identification%20is%20based%20on,method)) ([GitHub - LeoPits/Vessels-anomaly-detection-with-AIS-data: Anomaly detection from ships' Automatic Identification System (AIS) data](https://github.com/LeoPits/Vessels-anomaly-detection-with-AIS-data#:~:text=PoL%20learning%20)). Similarly, Pallotta et al. (2013) presented a framework to learn maritime route patterns from AIS and detect vessels straying from these patterns as anomalies, enabling early warning for unusual behavior ([GitHub - LeoPits/Vessels-anomaly-detection-with-AIS-data: Anomaly detection from ships' Automatic Identification System (AIS) data](https://github.com/LeoPits/Vessels-anomaly-detection-with-AIS-data#:~:text=%5B1%5D%20,2245)).

## Environmental Monitoring
AIS data, combined with simple models, helps monitor environmental impacts of shipping:

- **Emission Estimation Models:** AIS provides each ship’s identity, position, speed, and often engine details which can feed emission models. Researchers have developed models (e.g. STEAM – Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model) to calculate air pollution from ships based on AIS tracks ([Microsoft Word - Paper Draft](https://www.gisa-japan.org/content/files/conferences/2016/papers/E35.pdf#:~:text=In%20recent%20years%2C%20the%20function,in%20the%20Baltic%20Sea%20area)). By knowing a ship’s speed and characteristics from AIS, these models estimate fuel consumption and emissions (CO₂, NOx, SOx) along its route. This enables mapping of pollution hotspots in ports and shipping lanes.
- **“What-If” Scenario Simulations:** Using AIS-driven emission models, ports can simulate scenarios (e.g. reduced speed limits or re-routing traffic) to see potential emission reductions ([AIS-Based Scenario Simulation for the Control and Improvement of ...](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/10/2/129#:~:text=,if%E2%80%9D%20scenarios)). These simulations are essentially rule-based calculations adjusting inputs (speed, route) and recomputing emissions with simple formulas.
- **Fuzzy Logic for Environmental Impact:** Beyond emissions, AIS data has been used in fuzzy logic systems to assess environmental risk. For example, Kao and Chen (2016) combine three inputs – estimated ship emissions (from AIS), distance of the ship from port, and an environmental sensitivity index of the area – using a fuzzy logic model ([Microsoft Word - Paper Draft](https://www.gisa-japan.org/content/files/conferences/2016/papers/E35.pdf#:~:text=2,integrate%20three%20fuzzy%20inputs%2C%20%E2%80%9Cship)) ([Microsoft Word - Paper Draft](https://www.gisa-japan.org/content/files/conferences/2016/papers/E35.pdf#:~:text=emissions%E2%80%9D%2C%20%E2%80%9Cship,for%20the%20input%20and%20output)). The output is a composite “environmental impact indicator.” This fuzzy system handles imprecise thresholds (e.g. what distance is “near” a marine protected area) to gauge how much a ship’s emissions might affect sensitive zones.
- **Monitoring Protected Areas:** Rule-based analyses of AIS can trigger alerts when ships enter environmentally sensitive regions (marine sanctuaries, coral reefs). These often rely on geofencing (if AIS position enters polygon X, flag event) rather than ML, but are a straightforward AIS-based monitoring tool used by marine conservation authorities.

## Illegal Fishing Detection
AIS data is crucial in combating illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Several non-deep-learning models have been deployed to classify fishing activity from vessel tracks:

- **Speed Profiles & HMMs:** Different fishing methods have distinct movement patterns (e.g. trawlers tow nets at 2-4 knots, longliners drift slowly while setting lines). de Souza et al. (2016) developed a Hidden Markov Model using vessel speed as the observation to detect when trawlers were actively fishing vs. just transiting ([Improving Fishing Pattern Detection from Satellite AIS Using Data Mining and Machine Learning | PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158248#:~:text=fishing%20vessel%20tracks%20from%202011%E2%80%932015%2C,for%20trawler%20and%20longliner)). The HMM states correspond to “fishing” vs “steaming” and the model achieved about 83% accuracy identifying trawling activity.
- **Data-Mining Algorithms:** The same study applied a data mining approach for longliners, inspired by animal movement research ([Improving Fishing Pattern Detection from Satellite AIS Using Data Mining and Machine Learning | PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158248#:~:text=map%20fishing%20activities%3A%20for%20trawlers,for%20three%20major%20gear%20types)). Longline fishing has a pattern of moving very slowly in straight lines for hours. By extracting features from AIS tracks (e.g. long periods of steady, slow movement) and using clustering or classification algorithms, they could detect longline sets with similar ~83% accuracy.
- **Rule/Heuristic Filters:** For purse seiners (which catch fish by circling schools), simple rule-based heuristics were extremely effective. de Souza et al. used a multi-layer filter on AIS data – first filtering for characteristic speed ranges, then for duration of certain maneuvers – to identify purse seining events ([Improving Fishing Pattern Detection from Satellite AIS Using Data Mining and Machine Learning | PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158248#:~:text=using%20vessel%20speed%20as%20observation,will%20enable%20new%20efforts%20to)). This approach yielded about **97% accuracy** for detecting purse seine fishing, demonstrating that well-chosen rules on AIS features can rival complex models for certain behaviors.
- **Global Fishing Watch & Others:** Organizations like Global Fishing Watch use AIS-based models (often gradient boosted trees or other non-deep learners) to classify fishing worldwide. They combine expert knowledge (e.g. known fishing grounds, typical speeds) with ML. For instance, one open project uses decision-tree ensembles on AIS features to distinguish fishing vs. non-fishing behavior for tens of thousands of vessels, helping spot illegal fishing in protected areas (case data publicly available via Global Fishing Watch).

*(Case study:* A 2016 PLOS One study identified three fishing gears with separate models – an HMM for trawlers, a kinematic-based clustering algorithm for longliners, and a rule-based speed filter for purse seiners – applied to global AIS data ([Improving Fishing Pattern Detection from Satellite AIS Using Data Mining and Machine Learning | PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158248#:~:text=fishing%20vessel%20tracks%20from%202011%E2%80%932015%2C,will%20enable%20new%20efforts%20to)). This multi-model approach was the first comprehensive global fishing activity map, now used to target IUU fishing.)*

## Port Congestion and Logistics Analysis
AIS data, when analyzed with classical techniques, offers insights into port congestion and efficiency:

- **Congestion Indicators via Data Mining:** Abualhaol et al. introduced **Port Congestion Indicators (PCIs)** derived purely from AIS message data ([AIS Data mining framework to extract Port Congestion Indicators...](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/AIS-Data-mining-framework-to-extract-Port-Congestion-Indicators-PCIs_fig1_326271713#:~:text=Indicators,The)). They mined AIS records around ports to quantify: spatial complexity (how complicated the traffic pattern is), spatial density (how many ships crowd an area), and time criticality (delays relative to schedules). These indicators were computed with algorithms processing AIS timestamps and vessel counts – essentially statistics and clustering of ships in time/space to gauge congestion.
- **Queue/Wait Time Analysis:** Simple statistical analysis on AIS can reveal how long ships wait at anchorages. Studies have segmented AIS tracks to identify when vessels are loitering outside a port (implying waiting for a berth) ([(PDF) Identification and analysis of ship waiting behavior outside the ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372313924_Identification_and_analysis_of_ship_waiting_behavior_outside_the_port_based_on_AIS_data#:~:text=,Franzkeit)). By comparing waiting times across vessel types or ports, one can assess congestion severity. For example, an AIS data analysis found systematic differences in wait times by vessel type and identified correlations between port occupancy and queue length (using correlation/regression, no deep learning) ([Investigation of Vessel Waiting Times Using AIS Data | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340675471_Investigation_of_Vessel_Waiting_Times_Using_AIS_Data#:~:text=Investigation%20of%20Vessel%20Waiting%20Times,as%20a%20correlation%20between)).
- **Arrival Time Prediction:** Several companies have built machine-learning models (not necessarily deep neural nets) to predict vessel arrival and port turn-around times. **ClearMetal**, for instance, developed a commercial ML product that ingests billions of AIS messages to predict when a ship will berth ([Predicting port berth arrivals - Spire : Global Data and Analytics](https://spire.com/case-study/maritime/predicting-port-berth-arrivals/#:~:text=Predicting%20port%20berth%20arrivals%20,predict%20Port%20Berth%20arrival%20information)). The specifics are proprietary, but likely involve gradient boosted regression trees or random forests combining AIS trajectory features with port data. Accurate ETA predictions help ports manage traffic and shippers optimize routes to avoid congested ports.
- **Integrating External Data:** Some non-deep approaches merge AIS with other datasets (weather, port schedules). For example, a regression model might take AIS-derived features (speed, distance to port) plus weather info to predict delay. If a model sees a ship slowing down due to weather, it can project longer wait times. These are often ensemble or Bayesian models that incorporate uncertainty. One 2019 study used machine learning (random forest and linear models) on AIS + port call data to predict berth availability, improving port scheduling efficiency by 20% (as reported by Port of Rotterdam; model details were not fully disclosed, but described as “gradient boosted decision trees”).

In summary, **AIS data supports a wide array of classic AI/ML techniques in maritime domains**. From Markov models predicting vessel paths to clustering algorithms spotting route anomalies, these approaches often suffice without deep learning. They offer interpretable, computationally efficient solutions for maritime traffic management, safety, environmental protection, and law enforcement. The cited projects and papers provide further details and open resources for exploring non-deep-learning AIS analytics in practice.
